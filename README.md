# 🫀 Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Python


**📌 Overview**

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate prediction can play a vital role in timely treatment and saving lives. This mini-project leverages machine learning—specifically Logistic Regression—to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

This project was implemented using Python and executed on Google Colab, with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis forming the core workflow.

**🎯 Objectives**

To develop a system that can predict the presence of heart disease using medical attributes.

To reduce the cost of unnecessary medical testing by enabling early detection.

To assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease effectively.

**🧠 Machine Learning Approach**

**Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Frameworks/Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

**🗃️ Dataset Features**

The dataset used includes the following attributes:

🔗 age: Age of the patient

🔗 sex: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)

🔗 cp: Chest pain type (0–3)

🔗 trtbps: Resting blood pressure

🔗 chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

🔗 fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)

🔗 restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results

🔗 thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved

🔗 exng: Exercise induced angina

🔗 oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise

🔗 slp: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

🔗 caa: Number of major vessels (0–3)

🔗 thall: Thalassemia status

**Libraries:** 

scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

**✅ Results**

The trained model achieves reasonable accuracy in identifying whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, making it a valuable tool for preliminary risk assessment.

**🚀 Future Enhancements**

Long-term health
