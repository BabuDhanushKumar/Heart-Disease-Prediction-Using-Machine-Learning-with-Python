# 🫀 Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Python


📌 Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate prediction can play a vital role in timely treatment and saving lives. This mini-project leverages machine learning—specifically Logistic Regression—to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

This project was implemented using Python and executed on Google Colab, with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis forming the core workflow.

🎯 Objectives
To develop a system that can predict the presence of heart disease using medical attributes.

To reduce the cost of unnecessary medical testing by enabling early detection.

To assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease effectively.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Frameworks/Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

🗃️ Dataset Features
The dataset used includes the following attributes:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type (0–3)

trtbps: Resting blood pressure

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results

thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved

exng: Exercise induced angina

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise

slp: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

caa: Number of major vessels (0–3)

thall: Thalassemia status

🛠️ System Requirements
Hardware
Intel i3/i5 or higher

6 GB RAM or more

8 GB of free disk space (recommended)

Software
OS: Windows 7 or above

Python (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

✅ Results
The trained model achieves reasonable accuracy in identifying whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, making it a valuable tool for preliminary risk assessment.
